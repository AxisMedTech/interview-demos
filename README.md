#Xamarin Interview Demo
The goal of this demo is to give you a place to show off your Xamarin / C# / Development skills.

## Specification
Build a Xamarin Forms application for on both Android and iOS iPhones with a tab bar at the bottom of the page and 2 views.  [Click Here](https://github.com/AxisMedTech/xamarin-interview-demo/blob/master/mockup.pdf?raw=true) to get the mockup for the user interface interaction / flow.  For data use the SQLite-Net PCL nuget package and create the necessary entities.

#### Hobbies View
Create a list view with a few of your favorite hobbies.  Touching a cell will push to a hobby detail view.

#### Stock View
Make a list view that displays products that are in stock.

#### Form
Create a modal form with text input, inline date picker and on/off switch.  When the user clicks submit display the values as user readable text in an alert.  Upon dismissal of the alert view close the modal form.

## Goals
- Share as much code as possible
- Build at least one custom renderer
- Build a responsive user interface that scales to the different device sizes
- Gracefully handle loading states / waiting on data
- Use XAML when applicable
- Use MVVM pattern and data binding
- **Most importantly be creative and show off your development and design skills!**
